Problem: Team formation is chaos. People scramble through random chats and guesswork, leading to poor synergy and missed potential. Existing platforms don’t understand people, they just match keywords.
Solution: A smart, AI-driven team building platform that makes finding the right teammates effortless.
Using the Groq API, we implement AI matchmaking that understands skills, experience, and even work styles no need to build a model from scratch. To streamline onboarding, we auto-extract your tech stack via a LinkedIn scraper, so your profile is rich and accurate from day one.
But we go beyond matching. After every project, teammates leave feedback, powering a reputation system that grows with every collaboration. How will it help? Makes the profile an evolving portfolio not just a static resume.
We also introduce a survey system at the end of each event not only to improve matchmaking, but to generate valuable trend data. This anonymized insight can be monetized for companies seeking real-world developer patterns and behavior.
We’re targeting hackathon participants, student researchers, freelancers, and even recruiters and we’ll drive adoption through partnerships with hackathon organizers, community outreach, and a Discord-based ecosystem to kill the cold start problem.
It’s secure, it’s scalable, and it’s designed to evolve with future integration into platforms like GitHub and Devfolio, and applications in hiring, research, and startup team formation.
We're not just building a tool, we're building the infrastructure for meaningful, data-backed collaboration.
